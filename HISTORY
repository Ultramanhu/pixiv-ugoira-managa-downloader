Convert the ugoira on Pixiv to GIF or WebM file, and pack the images of manga to download without change page or open new tab.

Notice:
If you have trouble with old Pixiv site with version >=1.5 extension, plz goto my github page and download version 1.4.1 and disable the store version in Chrome extension page, then it should work.
